I am a 4th year undergraduate student studying computer science with a mathematics minor and pursuing academic research.

I am interested in perception, whether it's by machines or humans or whether it's via colours, depths, or something else. The perception I wish to study is not just the mere encounter with external stimuli but also the filtering, summarizing, experiencing, and so many more cognitive and computational processes that accompany it, whether it'd be naturally occurring in humans or ingeniously implemented in machines.

In my free time, I love learning languages and the linguistic facts about them. Thanks to my upbringing, I acquired Mandarin Chinese and English across Hangzhou and Vancouver. I then learned Spanish in school, and now I am learning Japanese and French for fun. It does pay off massively for cultural understanding when travelling, which is why I love the latter also!

My favourite sports are tennis and skiing/snowboarding.
